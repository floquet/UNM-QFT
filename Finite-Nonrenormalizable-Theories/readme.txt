Some nonrenormalizable theories are finite
Kevin Cahill

Some nonrenormalizable theories are less singular than all renormalizable theories, and one
can use lattice simulations to extract physical information from them. This paper discusses four
nonrenormalizable theories that have finite euclidian and minkowskian Greenâ€™s functions. Two of
them have finite euclidian action densities and describe scalar bosons of finite mass. The space of
nonsingular nonrenormalizable theories is vast.
